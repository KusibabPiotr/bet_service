## General info
It is best to learn programming through practice. My motivation to build this application is the desire to consolidate technology and acquire new skills. 
The application allows you to register, log in, check the results of matches in a given season for available leagues. You can also add bets to the card and 
settle the winnings(not real). It's not ready yet :(
