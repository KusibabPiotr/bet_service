## General info
It is best to learn programming through practice. My motivation to build this application is the desire to consolidate technology and acquire new skills. Basicly this 
is REST API for now. Later on I'll build frontend using React. The application allows you to register, log in, check the results of matches in a given season for available leagues. You can also add bets to the card and settle the winnings(not real). Secured by Spring Security. Authorization using JWT. In progress... :(
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java JDK 13
* Spring Boot 2.6.2
* MySQL
* H2 Database
* Hibernate
* React(future frontend)

## Features
* if you are not app user you can only view available leagues and football matches for actueal season
